# Information for developers
A detailed description of how the MassOS build system works can be found at [Building MassOS](https://github.com/MassOS-Linux/MassOS/wiki/Building-MassOS).

This repository contains the source and build system for the core MassOS system (stage 1 and stage 2), as well as Xfce (stage 3). The GNOME port is submoduled at `stage3/gnome`, and any further desktop environments which become supported in the future will also be submoduled. The GNOME port is maintained at the [MassOS-GNOME](https://github.com/MassOS-Linux/MassOS-GNOME) repository.

This repository now also contains the script and data used to create a live CD ISO image from a MassOS build. It should be noted that the files in the [livecd-installer](https://github.com/MassOS-Linux/livecd-installer) repository are deprecated; MassOS now uses [osinstallgui](https://github.com/DanielMYT/osinstallgui) as its installation program.

All repositories for the MassOS project can be found [here](https://github.com/orgs/MassOS-Linux/repositories).
